\section*{Quiz 1.4: Pseudorandomness}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=OliveGreen!30!white,colback=OliveGreen!5!white]
	This completely optional quick quiz acts as a learning aid to help you find out how much you absorbed from our Pseudorandomness session.\footnote{\url{https://appliedcryptography.page/slides/\#1-4}} Remember, this is just for fun and to help you identify areas you might want to review. Each question has three possible answers, but only one is correct. Take your time, and when you're done, check your answers against the answer key at the end. Good luck!
