				<h3 class="subsection-title">Course Description</h3>
				<p><em>Applied Cryptography</em> explores the core theory of modern cryptography and how to apply these fundamental principles to build and analyze real-world secure systems. We start with foundational concepts—such as Kerckhoff's Principle, computational hardness, and provable security—before moving on to key cryptographic primitives like pseudorandom generators, block ciphers, and hash functions. Building on this solid groundwork, we will survey how these technologies power critical real-world deployments such as TLS, secure messaging protocols (e.g., Signal), and post-quantum cryptography. We will also delve into specialized topics like high-assurance cryptographic implementations, elliptic-curve-based systems, and zero-knowledge proofs to give you a complete understanding of contemporary cryptography's scope and impact. By the end of the semester, you will have gained both a rigorous theoretical perspective and practical hands-on experience, enabling you to evaluate, design, and implement cryptographic solutions.</p>

				Every lecture will be accompanied by outside readings that expand on what is discussed in class or present the same material in a different way. Neither the readings nor the lectures are a replacement for each other; deeply understanding the material will likely require attendance as well as reading. It is possible to read before or after class, depending on your learning style.
			</p>
			<p>
				Aside from the textbooks and materials, students will also require their own personal computer for various parts of this course. Linux, Mac and Windows computers are all suitable.

						<strong>Part 1</strong> explores the theoretical underpinnings of modern cryptography through the lens of provable security. Starting with introductory concepts and perfect secrecy in the one-time pad, we progressively build a rigorous framework for understanding and analyzing cryptographic primitives. We examine fundamental building blocks like pseudorandom generators, functions, and permutations, then advance to encryption schemes secure against increasingly powerful adversaries—from passive eavesdroppers to active attackers who can manipulate ciphertexts. The section also covers essential cryptographic tools including collision-resistant hash functions, digital signatures, and key exchange protocols. Throughout these topics, we emphasize formal security definitions, reduction proofs, and the connections between theoretical security guarantees and practical implementations. By the end of this section, students will have developed a comprehensive understanding of provable security techniques that form the foundation for analyzing and designing secure cryptographic systems.

						<p class="topic-overview">This topic introduces the concept of perfect secrecy through the One-Time Pad (OTP) encryption system and explores its mathematical proof of unconditional security. While theoretically unbreakable, we'll examine the severe practical limitations that make OTP challenging to deploy in real-world systems, including key generation, distribution, and management problems. The topic then transitions to Kerckhoff's fundamental principle—that a cryptosystem should remain secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge. We'll discuss how this principle has shaped modern cryptographic design philosophy and why security through obscurity fails as a long-term strategy for protecting sensitive information.</p>

						<h4 class="topic-title"><i class="icon ph-duotone ph-chalkboard-teacher"></i>Provable Security &amp; Computational Cryptography</h4>
						<p class="topic-overview">This topic begins by delving into the rigorous mathematical frameworks that allow cryptographers to provide formal security guarantees for cryptographic schemes. We'll examine how precise definitions of security properties create a foundation for meaningful analysis, and explore various adversarial models that capture different threat scenarios. The concept of reduction—proving that breaking a scheme is at least as hard as solving some well-studied mathematical problem—will be thoroughly explored. We then transition to modern computational cryptography, moving from unconditional security to a more practical approach where security is defined against computationally bounded adversaries. Students will learn about indistinguishability as a fundamental security concept, the bad-event technique for security proofs, and birthday probabilities in cryptographic attacks. The session provides essential mathematical foundations for understanding modern cryptographic security, including quantitative intuition about large numbers (like 2<sup>128</sup>) and tiny probabilities (like 2<sup>-80</sup>) that define practical security boundaries, preparing students for subsequent topics in pseudorandomness.</p>

						<h4 class="topic-title"><i class="icon ph-duotone ph-chalkboard-teacher"></i>Pseudorandomness</h4>
						<p class="topic-overview">This topic explores three fundamental pseudorandom primitives that enable practical cryptography. Pseudorandom generators (PRGs) solve one-time pad's key length limitation by expanding short seeds into longer outputs indistinguishable from random. Pseudorandom functions (PRFs) extend this by creating massive virtual dictionaries mapping inputs to pseudorandom outputs, allowing parties with a shared secret to derive unlimited pseudorandom data. Pseudorandom permutations (PRPs), also called block ciphers, provide both forward and inverse operations indistinguishable from random permutations. We'll examine key constructions including GGM (building PRFs from PRGs), the Feistel network (building invertible PRPs from non-invertible PRFs), and the PRF-PRP switching lemma that enables interchangeability in security proofs. Throughout, we'll emphasize crucial security principles like the PRF "Golden Rule" of preventing input repetition.</p>

						<p class="topic-overview">This topic explores advanced security models for symmetric-key encryption, beginning with chosen-plaintext attack (CPA) security, where ciphertexts must be indistinguishable from random strings. We'll examine why deterministic encryption cannot achieve this security level and explore solutions including randomized PRF-based schemes and block cipher modes like CBC and CTR, while explaining why ECB mode remains fundamentally insecure. The topic then advances to chosen-ciphertext attacks (CCA), where adversaries can decrypt chosen ciphertexts, demonstrating how even CPA-secure schemes like CTR mode remain vulnerable due to their malleability. We'll analyze practical format-oracle attacks that exploit information leakage during decryption to recover entire plaintexts, and examine how preventing adversaries from creating valid modified ciphertexts is essential for achieving comprehensive CCA security in real-world systems.</p>

						<h4 class="topic-title"><i class="icon ph-duotone ph-chalkboard-teacher"></i>Collision-Resistant Hash Functions</h4>
						<p class="topic-overview">This topic explores collision-resistant hash functions, cryptographic primitives that convert arbitrary-length inputs to fixed-length outputs while making it computationally infeasible to find colliding inputs. We'll examine three essential properties—collision resistance, preimage resistance, and second preimage resistance—while exploring practical applications in password storage, data integrity verification, and proof-of-work systems. The topic introduces the counterintuitive birthday paradox, demonstrating why collisions can be found after approximately square-root-many attempts rather than brute force. We'll survey hash function evolution from broken algorithms like MD5 and SHA-1 to modern standards like SHA-2, SHA-3, and BLAKE3, while analyzing vulnerabilities including precomputation attacks using rainbow tables and length extension weaknesses in Merkle-Damg&#xE5;rd constructions. The topic covers critical defensive techniques including properly salting hashes and implementing specialized password hashing algorithms like PBKDF2 and memory-hard functions such as Scrypt, which resist hardware acceleration attacks by requiring significant memory resources, providing comprehensive guidance for secure hash function implementation in real-world systems.</p>

						<p class="topic-overview">This topic explores computational hardness problems that form the cornerstone of modern public-key cryptography, with particular focus on the discrete logarithm problem that underpins Diffie-Hellman key exchange. We'll examine how complexity theory provides a framework for classifying problems based on their computational difficulty, covering fundamental complexity classes including P, NP, and the famous unsolved P vs. NP problem. The topic then investigates the discrete logarithm problem in detail, analyzing its computational complexity and known algorithms, before exploring how this hard problem enables the revolutionary Diffie-Hellman protocol that allows two parties to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel. We'll examine the mathematical foundations of DH using modular exponentiation in prime fields, the computational hardness assumptions (CDH and DDH) that underpin its security, and protocol variants including anonymous and authenticated DH. The topic concludes by analyzing practical implementation considerations, security pitfalls, and how theoretical hardness assumptions translate into real-world cryptographic security.</p>

						<h4 class="topic-title"><i class="icon ph-duotone ph-chalkboard-teacher"></i>Elliptic Curves &amp; Digital Signatures</h4>
						<p class="topic-overview">This topic explores elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), an approach that provides stronger security with smaller keys than traditional cryptosystems like RSA. We'll examine the mathematical foundations of elliptic curves and their group structure supporting point addition and scalar multiplication operations. The topic covers the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) that underpins ECC's security, and how it enables efficient implementations of key exchange (ECDH) and digital signatures (ECDSA and EdDSA/Ed25519). We'll analyze the advantages of ECC, including faster signing operations and significantly shorter keys and signatures compared to RSA, while examining critical implementation considerations that affect security. The topic concludes with guidance on selecting appropriate curves, comparing standardized options like NIST curves and Curve25519, and exploring potential vulnerabilities including invalid curve attacks, randomness failures, and interoperability challenges in modern ECC deployments.</p>

						<strong>Part 2</strong> shifts from theoretical foundations to practical applications, examining how cryptographic principles are implemented in real-world systems. We begin with secure messaging protocols that provide forward secrecy and post-compromise security through ratcheting mechanisms, then explore authenticated key exchange protocols that secure communications against active adversaries. The section covers advanced concepts like zero-knowledge proofs that enable proving knowledge without revealing secrets, and post-quantum cryptography designed to resist attacks from quantum computers. We examine critical infrastructure protocols like TLS that secure internet communications, cloud security applications of cryptography, and analyze significant cryptographic failures to extract valuable design lessons. The course then investigates formal verification and high-assurance implementations that provide mathematical guarantees of security, specialized cryptography in cryptocurrencies, secure multiparty computation enabling joint computation without revealing inputs, and privacy-preserving technologies that protect sensitive information while enabling useful computation. By connecting theoretical foundations to practical systems, students will develop the knowledge needed to evaluate, implement, and design secure cryptographic solutions for complex real-world environments.

						<p class="topic-overview">This topic examines the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, the backbone of secure communication on the internet that secures billions of connections daily. We'll explore the evolution from SSL to modern TLS 1.3, analyzing the protocol architecture, handshake process, and the cryptographic primitives deployed at each stage. The session covers key exchange mechanisms, authentication methods, and the cipher suites that provide confidentiality and integrity protections. Students will learn about certificate validation, trust models, and the public key infrastructure (PKI) that underpins TLS security. We'll also investigate significant vulnerabilities that have affected TLS implementations throughout its history, including FREAK, Logjam, Heartbleed, and POODLE, analyzing how these vulnerabilities arose and the mitigations developed in response. The topic concludes with practical deployment considerations, performance optimizations like session resumption and 0-RTT, and the security trade-offs encountered when configuring TLS in production environments.</p>

						<h4 class="topic-title"><i class="icon ph-duotone ph-chalkboard-teacher"></i>The Story of RC4</h4>
						<p class="topic-overview">This topic presents a biographical narrative of RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4), tracing its remarkable journey from promising youth to eventual downfall in cryptographic history. We'll examine RC4's birth as a proprietary stream cipher at RSA Security in 1987, its meteoric rise to become the most widely deployed stream cipher in the world, and its golden era powering protocols like WEP, SSL, and TLS due to its simplicity and performance advantages. The topic then chronicles RC4's gradual decline as researchers uncovered a series of increasingly devastating weaknesses, starting with the 2001 Fluhrer-Mantin-Shamir attack on WEP, through the 2013 discovery of extensive biases in RC4-generated keystreams that enabled practical attacks against TLS, culminating in the 2015 "Bar Mitzvah" and RC4 NOMORE attacks that could recover passwords and other sensitive information from encrypted connections. We'll analyze how the security community responded to these revelations, including browser vendors' gradual restriction of RC4 ciphersuites and the IETF's eventual formal prohibition of RC4 in TLS in 2015, while drawing broader lessons about cryptographic lifecycle management, the importance of formal security analysis, and how the story of RC4 exemplifies both the evolution of cryptanalytic techniques and the challenges of maintaining backward compatibility in security protocols.</p>

						<h4 class="topic-title"><i class="icon ph-duotone ph-chalkboard-teacher"></i>Secure Messaging</h4>
						<p class="topic-overview">This topic traces the evolution of secure messaging from early failures to modern protocols, examining how cryptographic innovation has shaped private communication. We begin with PGP's usability challenges and fundamental limitations, understanding why "Johnny Can't Encrypt" despite decades of effort. The topic then explores Off-the-Record (OTR) messaging's revolutionary features—forward secrecy through ephemeral keys, deniable authentication via MACs instead of signatures, and automatic key exchange—demonstrating how synchronous protocols solved many of PGP's problems. We dive deep into authenticated key exchange protocols like SIGMA, examining how they prevent man-in-the-middle attacks while maintaining identity protection. The discussion covers proper key derivation functions (HKDF) for deriving multiple keys from shared secrets, addressing the shortcomings of ad-hoc approaches. We then transition to Signal's asynchronous messaging architecture, analyzing X3DH key exchange and the Double Ratchet's elegant combination of symmetric and Diffie-Hellman ratcheting. The topic critically examines post-compromise security's promises versus reality, revealing through formal analysis why perfect healing is impossible in practical systems that must handle state loss. We also contrast Signal's approach with alternatives like Telegram's controversial design choices. Throughout, we'll analyze the fundamental trade-offs between security guarantees, usability, and real-world deployment constraints that shape how billions of messages are protected daily. We'll also examine modern extensions including secure group messaging protocols like MLS (Messaging Layer Security) that scale encrypted conversations to thousands of participants.</p>

						<p class="topic-overview">Can we develop end-to-end encrypted cloud storage with formal cryptographic foundations? We'll examine how recent attacks on major E2EE providers like MEGA and Nextcloud have exposed the lack of rigorous cryptographic foundations in this domain, leading to vulnerabilities that compromise millions of users' data. The session introduces a comprehensive framework for analyzing E2EE cloud storage, including formal syntax that captures core functionality (registration, authentication, file operations, and sharing) and game-based security notions for client-to-client confidentiality and integrity. Students will learn how to model complex, multi-round interactive protocols with arbitrary adversarial interleaving, understanding the subtle security challenges that arise when users rely on passwords for key management and must share files without trusting the server. We'll analyze how theoretical attacks manifest in real systems by formally capturing the MEGA vulnerabilities, then study CSS (Cloud Storage Scheme), a provably secure construction that achieves all desired functionality while defending against dictionary attacks inherent in password-based settings. Throughout, we'll grapple with fundamental tensions between security, usability, and practical deployment constraints, examining why E2EE cloud storage lags behind secure messaging and TLS in formal guarantees despite comparable adoption rates.</p>

						<h4 class="topic-title"><i class="icon ph-duotone ph-chalkboard-teacher"></i>High-Assurance Cryptography</h4>
						<p class="topic-overview">This topic explores high-assurance cryptography, examining how computer-aided cryptography (CAC) tools address the notorious difficulty of correctly designing, implementing, and deploying cryptographic systems. We'll analyze the three levels of complexity—design, implementation, and deployment—where subtle flaws can compromise security, understanding how formal verification provides mathematical guarantees at each level. The topic covers both symbolic and computational approaches to design-level security, comparing tools like ProVerif and Tamarin for protocol analysis with CryptoVerif and F* for computational proofs. Students will learn how modern verification techniques enable both functional correctness and performance optimization, challenging the traditional trade-off between verified code and speed. We'll examine implementation-level security challenges including side-channel attacks and constant-time programming, understanding how CAC tools can prove absence of timing leaks. The topic includes hands-on exploration of tools like the hax playground for extracting formal models from Rust code. Through a detailed case study of TLS 1.3's development, we'll see how formal methods transformed protocol design from reactive patching to proactive verification, discovering real vulnerabilities and influencing standardization. By understanding these high-assurance techniques, students will be equipped to apply formal methods to their own cryptographic implementations, bridging the gap between theoretical security and practical deployment.</p>

						<p class="topic-overview">This topic explores post-quantum cryptography, which addresses the threat quantum computers pose to current cryptographic systems. We'll examine how quantum algorithms like Shor's can break widely-used public-key cryptography based on factoring and discrete logarithms, while Grover's algorithm reduces symmetric-key security by effectively halving key lengths. The topic introduces the Learning With Errors (LWE) problem as a foundation for post-quantum cryptography, explaining how its computational hardness against quantum attacks makes it suitable for building secure cryptographic primitives. We'll analyze practical LWE-based key exchange protocols that form the basis for NIST's standardized post-quantum schemes like ML-KEM. Students will understand both the theoretical foundation of quantum-resistant cryptography and the practical considerations for implementing these systems in real-world applications, preparing them for the transition to a post-quantum cryptographic landscape.</p>

						<h4 class="topic-title"><i class="icon ph-duotone ph-chalkboard-teacher"></i>Cryptocurrency Cryptography</h4>
						<p class="topic-overview">This topic examines the cryptographic foundations of cryptocurrencies, tracing the evolution from Bitcoin's revolutionary peer-to-peer electronic cash system to Ethereum's programmable blockchain and modern scaling solutions. We begin with Bitcoin's elegant solution to the double-spending problem through proof-of-work consensus, exploring how cryptographic primitives like digital signatures, hash functions, and Merkle trees enable trustless digital money without central authorities. The topic analyzes Bitcoin's UTXO model, mining economics, difficulty adjustment mechanisms, and the security guarantees provided by computational work. We then transition to Ethereum's innovations, examining how smart contracts extend blockchain functionality beyond simple payments to enable complex decentralized applications through the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Students will learn about Solidity programming, understand critical security vulnerabilities like reentrancy attacks, and explore Ethereum's transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus. The topic concludes with an in-depth analysis of Layer 2 scaling solutions, comparing state channels, sidechains, optimistic rollups, and zero-knowledge rollups that achieve higher throughput while inheriting Layer 1 security. Throughout, we'll examine the fundamental trade-offs between decentralization, security, and scalability that shape cryptocurrency design, preparing students to understand and contribute to the rapidly evolving blockchain ecosystem.</p>

						<h4 class="topic-title"><i class="icon ph-duotone ph-chalkboard-teacher"></i>Zero-Knowledge Proofs</h4>
						<p class="topic-overview">This topic explores zero-knowledge proofs, which enable proving possession of secret information without revealing anything about the secret itself. We'll examine how these interactive protocols can authenticate a party's identity while maintaining deniability—allowing someone to prove they know a private key without creating evidence that could later convince others. The topic begins with the Schnorr identification protocol, which demonstrates this paradoxical capability through a clever three-move interaction. We'll then generalize to sigma protocols, a powerful class of interactive proofs with completeness, special soundness, and honest-verifier zero-knowledge properties. The topic covers several practical examples, including proofs of discrete log equality and complex logical conditions using AND/OR compositions. Finally, we'll explore how interactive proofs can be transformed into non-interactive proofs and digital signatures through the Fiat-Shamir transformation, which replaces the verifier with a cryptographic hash function. This transformation creates powerful primitives like Schnorr signatures but necessarily sacrifices the deniability property that makes interactive zero-knowledge proofs unique.</p>

						<h4 class="topic-title"><i class="icon ph-duotone ph-chalkboard-teacher"></i>Secure Multiparty Computation</h4>
						<p class="topic-overview">This topic explores Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC), a powerful cryptographic paradigm that enables multiple parties to jointly compute functions over their private inputs without revealing those inputs to each other. We'll examine the theoretical foundations of MPC, including feasibility results, security models, and the distinctions between semi-honest and malicious adversaries. The topic covers core MPC techniques including Yao's garbled circuits, secret sharing schemes like Shamir's threshold method, and oblivious transfer protocols that enable secure two-party computation. Students will learn about practical MPC frameworks and implementations such as SCALE-MAMBA, MP-SPDZ, and EMP-toolkit, analyzing their performance characteristics and security guarantees. We'll investigate applications of MPC across various domains, including private data analysis, secure auctions, privacy-preserving machine learning, and confidential financial systems. The topic also addresses performance optimizations like preprocessing, circuit minimization, and communication-efficient protocols that make MPC increasingly practical for real-world use. We'll conclude with case studies of deployed MPC systems, examining how these technologies overcome real-world implementation challenges to enable secure collaboration while maintaining strict privacy guarantees.</p>

						<h4 class="topic-title"><i class="icon ph-duotone ph-chalkboard-teacher"></i>Creative Cryptography</h4>
						<p class="topic-overview">This topic explores timelock encryption, a fascinating cryptographic innovation that enables messages to be encrypted such that they can only be decrypted after a predetermined time has elapsed. We'll examine both the theoretical foundations and practical implementation of timelock encryption using the League of Entropy, an existing threshold network that implements threshold BLS signatures within Boneh and Franklin's identity-based encryption (IBE) framework. The topic demonstrates how this network, which broadcasts BLS signatures for each time interval (round number), effectively functions as a decentralized key custodian that periodically publishes private keys for an IBE system where identities correspond to specific time periods. We'll analyze the elegant design that requires cryptographic operations only from encryptors and decryptors while allowing the threshold network to remain unmodified and unaware of the timelock functionality. Students will gain hands-on experience with an open-source implementation of this scheme and explore a production-ready web interface utilizing the League of Entropy's distributed randomness beacon service. This creative application of cryptography showcases how existing cryptographic primitives can be combined in innovative ways to enable entirely new functionalities, inspiring students to think beyond conventional applications as they develop their own cryptographic solutions.</p>
