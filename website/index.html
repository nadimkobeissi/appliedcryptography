					<h3 class="subsection-title">Course Description</h3>
					<p><em>Applied Cryptography</em> explores the core theory of modern cryptography and how to apply these fundamental principles to build and analyze real-world secure systems. We start with foundational concepts—such as Kerckhoff's Principle, computational hardness, and provable security—before moving on to key cryptographic primitives like pseudorandom generators, block ciphers, and hash functions. Building on this solid groundwork, we will survey how these technologies power critical real-world deployments such as TLS, secure messaging protocols (e.g., Signal), and post-quantum cryptography. We will also delve into specialized topics like high-assurance cryptographic implementations, elliptic-curve-based systems, and zero-knowledge proofs to give you a complete understanding of contemporary cryptography's scope and impact. By the end of the semester, you will have gained both a rigorous theoretical perspective and practical hands-on experience, enabling you to evaluate, design, and implement cryptographic solutions.</p>

					<h3 class="news-title"><i class="icon ph-duotone ph-globe-hemisphere-west"></i>Global Interest and Major Updates!</h3>
					<p>The response to our Applied Cryptography course has been absolutely incredible! I've received emails expressing interest from students and professionals across the globe, from India to the UK, the United States and beyond. In just the past week alone, the course website has been visited by over 1,300 unique visitors from 79 different countries! Additionally, we've seen a tremendous surge in registrations from graduate and senior undergraduate students here at AUB this week. I'm genuinely excited and looking very much forward to meeting all of you soon!</p>
					<h4>New Classroom Location</h4>
					<p>Due to the larger-than-expected enrollment, we've secured a new, more spacious classroom for our lectures. The class will now be held in <strong>Nicely Hall, Room 212</strong>. This larger venue will ensure everyone has a comfortable learning environment as we explore the exciting world of cryptography together.</p>
					<h4>Optional Quizzes Added</h4>
					<p>
						To help reinforce your understanding of the material, I've added optional quick quizzes for each course topic! These fun, 20-question assessments are designed to test your comprehension of key concepts after each session. While they're completely optional, I highly encourage you to try them out—they're a great way to identify areas where you might want additional review and to solidify your understanding of the material we cover.<br />To access the quizzes, simply click the <strong><i class="icon ph-duotone ph-seal-question"></i>Quiz</strong> button underneath the <strong><i class="icon ph-duotone ph-projector-screen"></i>Slides</strong> button for each class topic on the website.
					</p>
					<h4>Programming Languages Finalized</h4>
					<p>I've also finalized the programming languages for our practical lab sessions: <strong>Rust</strong> and <strong>Go</strong>. These languages were specifically chosen for their exceptional suitability for cryptographic implementations. Both provide memory safety without garbage collection overhead, have strong type systems that catch errors at compile time, offer excellent performance characteristics, and include robust standard libraries with cryptographic primitives. Their modern tooling, clear error handling, and active communities developing high-quality cryptographic libraries make them ideal for learning to implement cryptographic protocols correctly and securely.</p>
					<h4>Questions and Contact</h4>
					<p>As we approach the start of the semester, please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions about the course, prerequisites, lab requirements, or anything else! Email me at <a href="mailto:cmps-297ad-396ai@nadim.email">cmps-297ad-396ai@nadim.email</a>. I'm here to help ensure you're fully prepared for this exciting journey into applied cryptography.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="collapsible-content">
						<p><strong>Programming languages for practical projects</strong> in this course are limited to <strong>Rust</strong> and <strong>Go</strong>. These languages were chosen for their exceptional suitability for cryptographic implementations: both provide memory safety without garbage collection overhead, have strong type systems that catch errors at compile time, offer excellent performance characteristics, and include robust standard libraries with cryptographic primitives. Additionally, both languages have active communities developing high-quality cryptographic libraries and are increasingly used in production security-critical systems. Their modern tooling and clear error handling make them ideal for students learning to implement cryptographic protocols correctly and securely.</p>

								<div>
									<h4 class="mb-2"><i class="icon ph-duotone ph-gear-six"></i>Rust</h4>
									<p class="mb-2">Rust is a systems programming language that guarantees memory safety and thread safety through its ownership system and borrow checker, eliminating entire classes of bugs at compile time. Its zero-cost abstractions and lack of runtime overhead make it perfect for cryptographic implementations where performance and correctness are paramount. Rust's type system and pattern matching enable expressing complex cryptographic protocols clearly while maintaining safety guarantees.</p>

									<h4 class="mb-2"><i class="icon ph-duotone ph-lightning"></i>Go</h4>
									<p class="mb-2">Go is a statically typed, compiled language designed for simplicity and reliability. Its built-in concurrency primitives (goroutines and channels) make it excellent for implementing networked cryptographic protocols. Go's straightforward syntax, automatic memory management, and comprehensive standard library (including crypto packages) allow students to focus on cryptographic concepts rather than language complexity. The language's emphasis on explicit error handling aligns well with the security-critical nature of cryptographic code.</p>

						<p><strong>Part 1</strong> explores the theoretical underpinnings of modern cryptography through the lens of provable security. Starting with introductory concepts and perfect secrecy in the one-time pad, we progressively build a rigorous framework for understanding and analyzing cryptographic primitives. We examine fundamental building blocks like pseudorandom generators, functions, and permutations, then advance to encryption schemes secure against increasingly powerful adversaries—from passive eavesdroppers to active attackers who can manipulate ciphertexts. The section also covers essential cryptographic tools including collision-resistant hash functions, digital signatures, and key exchange protocols. Throughout these topics, we emphasize formal security definitions, reduction proofs, and the connections between theoretical security guarantees and practical implementations. By the end of this section, students will have developed a comprehensive understanding of provable security techniques that form the foundation for analyzing and designing secure cryptographic systems.</p>

							<h4 class="topic-title"><i class="icon ph-duotone ph-chalkboard-teacher"></i>The Provable Security Mindset</h4>
							<p class="topic-overview">This topic introduces the concept of perfect secrecy through the One-Time Pad (OTP) encryption system and explores its mathematical proof of unconditional security. While theoretically unbreakable, we'll examine the severe practical limitations that make OTP challenging to deploy in real-world systems, including key generation, distribution, and management problems. The topic then transitions to Kerckhoff's fundamental principle—that a cryptosystem should remain secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge. We'll discuss how this principle has shaped modern cryptographic design philosophy and why security through obscurity fails as a long-term strategy for protecting sensitive information.</p>

							<h4 class="topic-title"><i class="icon ph-duotone ph-chalkboard-teacher"></i>Provable Security &amp; Computational Cryptography</h4>
							<p class="topic-overview">This topic begins by delving into the rigorous mathematical frameworks that allow cryptographers to provide formal security guarantees for cryptographic schemes. We'll examine how precise definitions of security properties create a foundation for meaningful analysis, and explore various adversarial models that capture different threat scenarios. The concept of reduction—proving that breaking a scheme is at least as hard as solving some well-studied mathematical problem—will be thoroughly explored. We then transition to modern computational cryptography, moving from unconditional security to a more practical approach where security is defined against computationally bounded adversaries. Students will learn about indistinguishability as a fundamental security concept, the bad-event technique for security proofs, and birthday probabilities in cryptographic attacks. The session provides essential mathematical foundations for understanding modern cryptographic security, including quantitative intuition about large numbers (like 2<sup>128</sup>) and tiny probabilities (like 2<sup>-80</sup>) that define practical security boundaries, preparing students for subsequent topics in pseudorandomness.</p>

							<h4 class="topic-title"><i class="icon ph-duotone ph-chalkboard-teacher"></i>Pseudorandomness</h4>
							<p class="topic-overview">This topic explores three fundamental pseudorandom primitives that enable practical cryptography. Pseudorandom generators (PRGs) solve one-time pad's key length limitation by expanding short seeds into longer outputs indistinguishable from random. Pseudorandom functions (PRFs) extend this by creating massive virtual dictionaries mapping inputs to pseudorandom outputs, allowing parties with a shared secret to derive unlimited pseudorandom data. Pseudorandom permutations (PRPs), also called block ciphers, provide both forward and inverse operations indistinguishable from random permutations. We'll examine key constructions including GGM (building PRFs from PRGs), the Feistel network (building invertible PRPs from non-invertible PRFs), and the PRF-PRP switching lemma that enables interchangeability in security proofs. Throughout, we'll emphasize crucial security principles like the PRF "Golden Rule" of preventing input repetition.</p>

							<p class="topic-overview">This topic explores advanced security models for symmetric-key encryption, beginning with chosen-plaintext attack (CPA) security, where ciphertexts must be indistinguishable from random strings. We'll examine why deterministic encryption cannot achieve this security level and explore solutions including randomized PRF-based schemes and block cipher modes like CBC and CTR, while explaining why ECB mode remains fundamentally insecure. The topic then advances to chosen-ciphertext attacks (CCA), where adversaries can decrypt chosen ciphertexts, demonstrating how even CPA-secure schemes like CTR mode remain vulnerable due to their malleability. We'll analyze practical format-oracle attacks that exploit information leakage during decryption to recover entire plaintexts, and examine how preventing adversaries from creating valid modified ciphertexts is essential for achieving comprehensive CCA security in real-world systems.</p>

							<p class="topic-overview">This topic explores collision-resistant hash functions, cryptographic primitives that convert arbitrary-length inputs to fixed-length outputs while making it computationally infeasible to find colliding inputs. We'll examine three essential properties—collision resistance, preimage resistance, and second preimage resistance—while exploring practical applications in password storage, data integrity verification, and proof-of-work systems. The topic introduces the counterintuitive birthday paradox, demonstrating why collisions can be found after approximately square-root-many attempts rather than brute force. We'll survey hash function evolution from broken algorithms like MD5 and SHA-1 to modern standards like SHA-2, SHA-3, and BLAKE3, while analyzing vulnerabilities including precomputation attacks using rainbow tables and length extension weaknesses in Merkle-Damg&#xE5;rd constructions. The topic covers critical defensive techniques including properly salting hashes and implementing specialized password hashing algorithms like PBKDF2 and memory-hard functions such as Scrypt, which resist hardware acceleration attacks by requiring significant memory resources, providing comprehensive guidance for secure hash function implementation in real-world systems.</p>

							<p class="topic-overview">This topic explores computational hardness problems that form the cornerstone of modern public-key cryptography, with particular focus on the discrete logarithm problem that underpins Diffie-Hellman key exchange. We'll examine how complexity theory provides a framework for classifying problems based on their computational difficulty, covering fundamental complexity classes including P, NP, and the famous unsolved P vs. NP problem. The topic then investigates the discrete logarithm problem in detail, analyzing its computational complexity and known algorithms, before exploring how this hard problem enables the revolutionary Diffie-Hellman protocol that allows two parties to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel. We'll examine the mathematical foundations of DH using modular exponentiation in prime fields, the computational hardness assumptions (CDH and DDH) that underpin its security, and protocol variants including anonymous and authenticated DH. The topic concludes by analyzing practical implementation considerations, security pitfalls, and how theoretical hardness assumptions translate into real-world cryptographic security.</p>

							<p class="topic-overview">This topic explores elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), an approach that provides stronger security with smaller keys than traditional cryptosystems like RSA. We'll examine the mathematical foundations of elliptic curves and their group structure supporting point addition and scalar multiplication operations. The topic covers the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) that underpins ECC's security, and how it enables efficient implementations of key exchange (ECDH) and digital signatures (ECDSA and EdDSA/Ed25519). We'll analyze the advantages of ECC, including faster signing operations and significantly shorter keys and signatures compared to RSA, while examining critical implementation considerations that affect security. The topic concludes with guidance on selecting appropriate curves, comparing standardized options like NIST curves and Curve25519, and exploring potential vulnerabilities including invalid curve attacks, randomness failures, and interoperability challenges in modern ECC deployments.</p>

						<p><strong>Part 2</strong> shifts from theoretical foundations to practical applications, examining how cryptographic principles are implemented in real-world systems. We begin with secure messaging protocols that provide forward secrecy and post-compromise security through ratcheting mechanisms, then explore authenticated key exchange protocols that secure communications against active adversaries. The section covers advanced concepts like zero-knowledge proofs that enable proving knowledge without revealing secrets, and post-quantum cryptography designed to resist attacks from quantum computers. We examine critical infrastructure protocols like TLS that secure internet communications, cloud security applications of cryptography, and analyze significant cryptographic failures to extract valuable design lessons. The course then investigates formal verification and high-assurance implementations that provide mathematical guarantees of security, specialized cryptography in cryptocurrencies, secure multiparty computation enabling joint computation without revealing inputs, and privacy-preserving technologies that protect sensitive information while enabling useful computation. By connecting theoretical foundations to practical systems, students will develop the knowledge needed to evaluate, implement, and design secure cryptographic solutions for complex real-world environments.</p>

We'll explore the evolution from SSL to modern TLS 1.3, analyzing the protocol architecture, handshake process, and the cryptographic primitives deployed at each stage. The session covers key exchange mechanisms, authentication methods, and the cipher suites that provide confidentiality and integrity protections. Students will learn about certificate validation, trust models, and the public key infrastructure (PKI) that underpins TLS security. We'll also investigate significant vulnerabilities that have affected TLS implementations throughout its history, including FREAK, Logjam, Heartbleed, and POODLE, analyzing how these vulnerabilities arose and the mitigations developed in response.

							<h4 class="topic-title"><i class="icon ph-duotone ph-chalkboard-teacher"></i>The Story of RC4</h4>
							<p class="topic-overview">This topic presents a biographical narrative of RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4), tracing its remarkable journey from promising youth to eventual downfall in cryptographic history. We'll examine RC4's birth as a proprietary stream cipher at RSA Security in 1987, its meteoric rise to become the most widely deployed stream cipher in the world, and its golden era powering protocols like WEP, SSL, and TLS due to its simplicity and performance advantages. The topic then chronicles RC4's gradual decline as researchers uncovered a series of increasingly devastating weaknesses, starting with the 2001 Fluhrer-Mantin-Shamir attack on WEP, through the 2013 discovery of extensive biases in RC4-generated keystreams that enabled practical attacks against TLS, culminating in the 2015 "Bar Mitzvah" and RC4 NOMORE attacks that could recover passwords and other sensitive information from encrypted connections. We'll analyze how the security community responded to these revelations, including browser vendors' gradual restriction of RC4 ciphersuites and the IETF's eventual formal prohibition of RC4 in TLS in 2015, while drawing broader lessons about cryptographic lifecycle management, the importance of formal security analysis, and how the story of RC4 exemplifies both the evolution of cryptanalytic techniques and the challenges of maintaining backward compatibility in security protocols.</p>

							<h4 class="topic-title"><i class="icon ph-duotone ph-chalkboard-teacher"></i>Secure Messaging</h4>
							<p class="topic-overview">This topic traces the evolution of secure messaging from early failures to modern protocols, examining how cryptographic innovation has shaped private communication. We begin with PGP's usability challenges and fundamental limitations, understanding why "Johnny Can't Encrypt" despite decades of effort. The topic then explores Off-the-Record (OTR) messaging's revolutionary features—forward secrecy through ephemeral keys, deniable authentication via MACs instead of signatures, and automatic key exchange—demonstrating how synchronous protocols solved many of PGP's problems. We dive deep into authenticated key exchange protocols like SIGMA, examining how they prevent man-in-the-middle attacks while maintaining identity protection. The discussion covers proper key derivation functions (HKDF) for deriving multiple keys from shared secrets, addressing the shortcomings of ad-hoc approaches. We then transition to Signal's asynchronous messaging architecture, analyzing X3DH key exchange and the Double Ratchet's elegant combination of symmetric and Diffie-Hellman ratcheting. The topic critically examines post-compromise security's promises versus reality, revealing through formal analysis why perfect healing is impossible in practical systems that must handle state loss. We also contrast Signal's approach with alternatives like Telegram's controversial design choices. Throughout, we'll analyze the fundamental trade-offs between security guarantees, usability, and real-world deployment constraints that shape how billions of messages are protected daily. We'll also examine modern extensions including secure group messaging protocols like MLS (Messaging Layer Security) that scale encrypted conversations to thousands of participants.</p>

							<h4 class="topic-title"><i class="icon ph-duotone ph-chalkboard-teacher"></i>End-to-End Encrypted Cloud Storage</h4>
							<p class="topic-overview">This topic examines end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) cloud storage systems, addressing the fundamental challenge of protecting user data from cloud providers while maintaining usability. We begin by contrasting regular cloud storage (where providers control encryption keys) with E2EE storage (where users control keys), exploring the security guarantees and usability trade-offs inherent in each approach. The topic analyzes critical failures in deployed E2EE storage systems, including the MEGA attacks that exploited missing integrity protection and weak password hashing to achieve complete key recovery, and the Nextcloud vulnerabilities that forced the company to disable core features due to authentication flaws and implementation bugs. We examine WhatsApp's encrypted backup system as a case study, analyzing both its innovative use of hardware security modules (HSMs) with the OPAQUE protocol for password-based key recovery, and its limitations including trust assumptions and specification ambiguities. The topic explores advanced authentication approaches beyond simple password hashing, including zero-knowledge protocols like SRP and OPAQUE that prevent offline dictionary attacks. We conclude by studying a formal treatment of E2EE cloud storage that demonstrates how to design provably secure protocols using standard cryptographic primitives, clean key hierarchies, and formal security analysis. Throughout, we emphasize that security requires more than encryption—authentication, integrity, and careful protocol design are equally critical—and that formal analysis before deployment is essential to avoid the costly failures seen in real-world systems.</p>

							<h4 class="topic-title"><i class="icon ph-duotone ph-chalkboard-teacher"></i>High-Assurance Cryptography</h4>
							<p class="topic-overview">This topic explores high-assurance cryptography, examining how computer-aided cryptography (CAC) tools address the notorious difficulty of correctly designing, implementing, and deploying cryptographic systems. We'll analyze the three levels of complexity—design, implementation, and deployment—where subtle flaws can compromise security, understanding how formal verification provides mathematical guarantees at each level. The topic covers both symbolic and computational approaches to design-level security, comparing tools like ProVerif and Tamarin for protocol analysis with CryptoVerif and F* for computational proofs. Students will learn how modern verification techniques enable both functional correctness and performance optimization, challenging the traditional trade-off between verified code and speed. We'll examine implementation-level security challenges including side-channel attacks and constant-time programming, understanding how CAC tools can prove absence of timing leaks. The topic includes hands-on exploration of tools like the hax playground for extracting formal models from Rust code. Through a detailed case study of TLS 1.3's development, we'll see how formal methods transformed protocol design from reactive patching to proactive verification, discovering real vulnerabilities and influencing standardization. By understanding these high-assurance techniques, students will be equipped to apply formal methods to their own cryptographic implementations, bridging the gap between theoretical security and practical deployment.</p>

							<p class="topic-overview">This topic explores post-quantum cryptography, which addresses the threat quantum computers pose to current cryptographic systems. We'll examine how quantum algorithms like Shor's can break widely-used public-key cryptography based on factoring and discrete logarithms, while Grover's algorithm reduces symmetric-key security by effectively halving key lengths. The topic introduces the Learning With Errors (LWE) problem as a foundation for post-quantum cryptography, explaining how its computational hardness against quantum attacks makes it suitable for building secure cryptographic primitives. We'll analyze practical LWE-based key exchange protocols that form the basis for NIST's standardized post-quantum schemes like ML-KEM. Students will understand both the theoretical foundation of quantum-resistant cryptography and the practical considerations for implementing these systems in real-world applications, preparing them for the transition to a post-quantum cryptographic landscape.</p>

							<h4 class="topic-title"><i class="icon ph-duotone ph-chalkboard-teacher"></i>Cryptocurrency Cryptography</h4>
							<p class="topic-overview">This topic examines the cryptographic foundations of cryptocurrencies, tracing the evolution from Bitcoin's revolutionary peer-to-peer electronic cash system to Ethereum's programmable blockchain and modern scaling solutions. We begin with Bitcoin's elegant solution to the double-spending problem through proof-of-work consensus, exploring how cryptographic primitives like digital signatures, hash functions, and Merkle trees enable trustless digital money without central authorities. The topic analyzes Bitcoin's UTXO model, mining economics, difficulty adjustment mechanisms, and the security guarantees provided by computational work. We then transition to Ethereum's innovations, examining how smart contracts extend blockchain functionality beyond simple payments to enable complex decentralized applications through the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Students will learn about Solidity programming, understand critical security vulnerabilities like reentrancy attacks, and explore Ethereum's transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus. The topic concludes with an in-depth analysis of Layer 2 scaling solutions, comparing state channels, sidechains, optimistic rollups, and zero-knowledge rollups that achieve higher throughput while inheriting Layer 1 security. Throughout, we'll examine the fundamental trade-offs between decentralization, security, and scalability that shape cryptocurrency design, preparing students to understand and contribute to the rapidly evolving blockchain ecosystem.</p>

							<h4 class="topic-title"><i class="icon ph-duotone ph-chalkboard-teacher"></i>Zero-Knowledge Proofs</h4>
							<p class="topic-overview">This topic explores zero-knowledge proofs, a cryptographic innovation that enables proving knowledge of information without revealing the information itself. We begin with the fundamental paradox: how can one convince a verifier of knowing a secret while revealing nothing about it? The topic introduces the three essential properties—completeness (honest provers succeed), soundness (dishonest provers fail), and zero-knowledge (no information leakage)—through concrete examples like the Schnorr identification protocol. We examine Sigma protocols as a general framework for interactive zero-knowledge proofs, understanding their characteristic three-message structure and how they can prove complex statements through AND/OR compositions. The topic then explores the Fiat-Shamir transformation, which converts interactive proofs into non-interactive ones using hash functions, enabling applications like digital signatures and blockchain protocols. We analyze the shift from custom protocols to general-purpose zero-knowledge systems based on arithmetic circuits, allowing developers to prove arbitrary computations while hiding sensitive inputs. The topic includes critical analysis of recent attacks on Fiat-Shamir that demonstrate the fragility of theoretical security in practice. Finally, we examine real-world deployments including Zcash's privacy-preserving cryptocurrency and Google's recent open-source initiative for age verification, exploring how zero-knowledge proofs are transitioning from academic theory to mainstream technology that could fundamentally reshape online privacy and digital identity.</p>

							<p class="topic-overview">This topic explores Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC), a powerful cryptographic paradigm that enables multiple parties to jointly compute functions over their private inputs without revealing those inputs to each other. We'll examine the theoretical foundations of MPC, including feasibility results, security models, and the distinctions between semi-honest and malicious adversaries. The topic covers core MPC techniques including Yao's garbled circuits, secret sharing schemes like Shamir's threshold method, and oblivious transfer protocols that enable secure two-party computation. Students will learn about practical MPC frameworks and implementations such as SCALE-MAMBA, MP-SPDZ, and EMP-toolkit, analyzing their performance characteristics and security guarantees. We'll investigate applications of MPC across various domains, including private data analysis, secure auctions, privacy-preserving machine learning, and confidential financial systems. The topic also addresses performance optimizations like preprocessing, circuit minimization, and communication-efficient protocols that make MPC increasingly practical for real-world use. We'll conclude with case studies of deployed MPC systems, examining how these technologies overcome real-world implementation challenges to enable secure collaboration while maintaining strict privacy guarantees.</p>

							<h4 class="topic-title"><i class="icon ph-duotone ph-chalkboard-teacher"></i>Creative Cryptography</h4>
							<p class="topic-overview">This topic explores timelock encryption, a fascinating cryptographic innovation that enables messages to be encrypted such that they can only be decrypted after a predetermined time has elapsed. We'll examine both the theoretical foundations and practical implementation of timelock encryption using the League of Entropy, an existing threshold network that implements threshold BLS signatures within Boneh and Franklin's identity-based encryption (IBE) framework. The topic demonstrates how this network, which broadcasts BLS signatures for each time interval (round number), effectively functions as a decentralized key custodian that periodically publishes private keys for an IBE system where identities correspond to specific time periods. We'll analyze the elegant design that requires cryptographic operations only from encryptors and decryptors while allowing the threshold network to remain unmodified and unaware of the timelock functionality. Students will gain hands-on experience with an open-source implementation of this scheme and explore a production-ready web interface utilizing the League of Entropy's distributed randomness beacon service. This creative application of cryptography showcases how existing cryptographic primitives can be combined in innovative ways to enable entirely new functionalities, inspiring students to think beyond conventional applications as they develop their own cryptographic solutions.</p>

							<p class="mb-0">In this lab project, you will build a practical timelock encryption system that enables messages to be encrypted such that they can only be decrypted after a specific future time. You'll implement the tlock protocol using the League of Entropy's distributed randomness beacon, which broadcasts threshold BLS signatures that serve as time-based decryption keys. The lab guides you through implementing identity-based encryption where "identities" are future timestamps, creating a web application for encrypting time-locked messages, and building a decryption service that automatically reveals messages at the specified time. You'll explore real-world applications including scheduled disclosures, commitment schemes for auctions, and "digital time capsules" for personal messages. The project includes challenges like handling network failures, caching beacon signatures efficiently, and designing user interfaces that clearly communicate the irreversible nature of timelock encryption. By completing this lab, you'll gain hands-on experience with threshold cryptography, distributed trust models, and creative applications of existing cryptographic infrastructure for novel purposes.</p>

							<h4 class="mb-2"><i class="icon ph-duotone ph-lightbulb"></i>Propose your own lab project!</h4>
							<p class="mb-0">Take the opportunity to propose and develop your own cryptographic project based on your interests and the concepts covered in the course! You might implement a novel protocol, create a secure application, perform a cryptanalysis of an existing system, or conduct formal verification of a protocol. Your proposal should include your project goals, the cryptographic primitives or techniques you'll explore, implementation details, and how you'll evaluate its security properties. This self-directed project allows you to delve deeper into an area of applied cryptography that particularly interests you while demonstrating your understanding of the course material in a creative and practical context.</p>
