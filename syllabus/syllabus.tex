\section*{Course Syllabus}

\textit{Applied Cryptography} explores the core theory of modern cryptography and how to apply these fundamental principles to build and analyze real-world secure systems. We start with foundational concepts—such as Kerckhoff's Principle, computational hardness, and provable security—before moving on to key cryptographic primitives like pseudorandom generators, block ciphers, and hash functions. Building on this solid groundwork, we will survey how these technologies power critical real-world deployments such as TLS, secure messaging protocols (e.g., Signal), and post-quantum cryptography. We will also delve into specialized topics like high-assurance cryptographic implementations, elliptic-curve-based systems, and zero-knowledge proofs to give you a complete understanding of contemporary cryptography's scope and impact. By the end of the semester, you will have gained both a rigorous theoretical perspective and practical hands-on experience, enabling you to evaluate, design, and implement cryptographic solutions.

\section{Course Objectives \& Outcomes}
This course is designed to bridge the theoretical foundations of cryptography with its practical applications in contemporary secure systems. By engaging with lectures, lab projects, problem sets, and project work, you will develop a thorough understanding of modern cryptographic concepts and gain the hands-on skills needed to implement, assess, and communicate security solutions.

Upon successful completion of this course, a student should be able to:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Understand the reasoning behind the mathematical underpinnings of modern cryptography.
	\item Analyze and prove the security properties of cryptographic constructions.
	\item Understand how cryptographic constructions can be composed to build secure protocols and systems.
	\item Discern between how cryptography is approached mathematically versus from an engineering perspective.
	\item Critically assess security implementations and evaluate real-world cryptographic protocols.
	\item Gain an understanding about the future of cryptography and its role in emerging technologies.
\end{itemize}

\section{Assessment Items \& Grading Criteria}
In this course, your performance will be evaluated through multiple components designed to measure both your theoretical understanding and your practical skills in cryptography. By staying current with the readings, attending and participating in lectures and lab projects, and completing all assigned work, you will gain a thorough mastery of the material.

Overall, these graded components are designed to ensure that you not only grasp the theoretical underpinnings of cryptography but also develop the practical expertise needed to implement, analyze, and innovate within the field.

\subsection{This Is Your Classroom}
An essential facet in this course's design is encouraging students to produce work that is entirely theirs, without resorting to AI technologies. This ensures that students are embracing their full learning potential and makes grading more fair throughout the classroom. As such, the class sessions and lab projects will favor \textbf{engagement}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Interactive lectures:} Classes will incorporate interactive elements such as in-class exercises, discussions, and collaborative problem-solving to encourage active participation.
	\item \textbf{Real-time feedback:} Students will regularly have opportunities to demonstrate their understanding through low-stakes activities, receiving immediate feedback to guide their learning.
	\item \textbf{Peer teaching:} Students will occasionally be invited to explain concepts to their peers, reinforcing their own understanding while creating a collaborative learning environment.
	\item \textbf{Lab progress discussions:} Students will be encouraged to openly discuss their progress on lab projects as they work, allowing for real-time problem-solving and knowledge sharing.
	\item \textbf{Security strategy workshops:} Throughout lab projects, students will present their approaches to implementing security goals, receiving feedback from peers and instructors to refine their solutions.
	\item \textbf{Collaborative troubleshooting:} Labs will incorporate structured time for students to collectively address challenges, fostering a community where security insights and implementation techniques are freely exchanged.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Problem Sets}
Problem sets will be assigned periodically throughout the semester to reinforce and deepen your understanding of the lecture material. Each set will include a range of exercises—some focused on theoretical proofs and problem-solving, others requiring short coding tasks or computational experiments. These assignments are designed to bridge the gap between abstract cryptographic concepts and their concrete applications. You are encouraged to start working on each problem set early and to seek guidance during office hours or lab projects if you encounter difficulties.

\subsection{Lab Projects}
Lab projects will be worked on weekly during lab sessions intended to serve as a hands-on complement to the lectures. Each group of (one to three) students is expected to pick at most two lab topics and work on them throughout the entire course. During each lab, you will experiment with real-world libraries, and even simulate attacks or vulnerabilities to understand why certain security practices are necessary. These sessions will also help you become comfortable with relevant tools and environments, including formal analysis tools. Attendance is mandatory, and lab participation will be graded based on preparedness, engagement, and the successful completion of in-lab activities. Labs offer an excellent opportunity for collaborative problem-solving and immediate feedback on your work.

Example lab sessions include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Zero-Knowledge Battleship:} Build a secure battleship game that uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify that the server is reporting ship hits honestly without revealing the entire board layout. This lab explores ZKP implementations and demonstrates their power in creating trustworthy interactive applications.
	\item \textbf{Cryptographic Protocol Reverse Engineering:} Analyze real-world mobile applications to identify how they implement cryptographic protocols, discover potential vulnerabilities, and understand how protocol design flaws can lead to security breaches.
	\item \textbf{Breaking Cloud Storage Encryption:} Investigate current research into vulnerabilities in cloud storage encryption protocols. Implement proof-of-concept attacks in a controlled environment and propose mitigations for the discovered vulnerabilities.
	\item \textbf{Implementation of Secure Messaging Protocols:} Implement a simplified version of the Signal Protocol for secure messaging, focusing on the Double Ratchet algorithm and how it provides forward secrecy and post-compromise security.
	\item \textbf{Side-Channel Attack Workshop:} Perform practical timing and power analysis attacks against basic cryptographic implementations to understand the importance of constant-time algorithms and other side-channel mitigations.
	\item \textbf{Post-Quantum Cryptography Evaluation:} Compare and test different post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, analyzing their performance, security margins, and implementation challenges.
	\item \textbf{Formal Verification with Verifpal, Progressing to Tamarin:} Model cryptographic protocols first using Verifpal as a learning tool and then progressing towards mature tools such as Tamarin, automatically verifying their security properties, learning how formal methods can discover subtle vulnerabilities that manual review might miss.
\end{itemize}

Lab participation will be graded based on preparedness, engagement, demonstrated understanding during checkpoints, and the successful completion of in-lab activities.

\subsection{Exams}
There will be a midterm exam and a final exam. The exams will test your command of topics discussed throughout the semester. You are expected to come to each exam prepared, having thoroughly reviewed lecture notes, and lab material.

\subsection{Grading Breakdown}
The final course grade will be computed using the following breakdown:

\section{The Key Exchange}
\textit{The Key Exchange} is an optional weekly gathering intended to provide additional career training for students intending to become researchers or career professionals in cryptography. Once a week, we will come together to discuss cutting-edge research papers, work on our presentation skills by practicing presenting complex ideas, develop scientific writing skills, and explore career paths in cryptography. Whether you're debugging your first encryption algorithm or designing novel protocols, \textit{The Key Exchange} provides a supportive environment where questions are encouraged, mistakes become learning opportunities, and everyone has something valuable to contribute. The only prerequisite is your curiosity!

What makes \textit{The Key Exchange} special isn't just what we learn, but how we learn together. In our relaxed, coffee-shop-style sessions, you'll gain skills that textbooks can't teach: how to read research papers efficiently, present technical concepts clearly, write like a cryptographer, and navigate career decisions with confidence. One week you might be discussing the elegance of elliptic curves with a visiting researcher from Signal, the next you're getting feedback on your presentation about side-channel attacks, and the following week you're collaborating on a blog post explaining zero-knowledge proofs to a general audience. With our rotating format of paper discussions, student presentations, writing workshops, and career cafés, you'll build a portfolio of skills while forming lasting connections with peers who share your passion for cryptography. After all, the best cryptographic protocols are built on collaboration, and \textit{The Key Exchange} is where your journey as a cryptographer truly begins!
