# Random Notes for Me (Please Ignore)

- [ ] Every time I show a new security property in Part 1, I should link it to an attack. This means redoing all the Part 1 slides after a first pass where I integrate the Joy of Cryptography materials. Eg. I describe what uniform sampling is? OK, look what happened with [PuTTY](https://thehackernews.com/2024/04/widely-used-putty-ssh-client-found.html) when they didn't respect this! See? This stuff matters in the real world!
- [ ] An "escape hatch" into more informal proofs should be readily available in the event of running out of time, etc., but should not be too heavily relied upon.
- [ ] None of the material covers key management. [Alfred Menezes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9e023bTfes&list=PLA1qgQLL41SRn_23p8zD0vUpKM4qOgt_T&index=6) may come to the rescue.
- [ ] **Must** be up-front about exam-required materials. Tell students what's required for each exam first thing. That way, you remove anxiety, and allow them to explore the materials at their leisure.
- [ ] [This website](https://asecuritysite.com/range/age) is full of useful practical examples, here we have range proofs.
- [ ] Not enough attack labs.
- [ ] Might be fun to cover QUIC, HTTP/3, Passkeys...
- [ ] Session on side-channels?
- [ ] Integrate Verifpal as learning tool
- [ ] [Amazing teaching style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOGdb1CTu5c)
- [ ] [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) might be useful.
