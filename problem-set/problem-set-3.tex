\section{Cryptographic Hardness and Real-World Implications (20 points)}

\subsection{Breaking Cryptography: Attack Scenarios (10 points)}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item (5 points) \textbf{The Cryptographic Apocalypse Scenario:}
	      Imagine you wake up tomorrow to headlines: \textit{``Breakthrough Algorithm Solves P vs NP - Computer Scientists Prove P = NP!''}
	      \begin{enumerate}
		      \item As the Chief Security Officer of a major bank, write a crisis response memo outlining which systems fail immediately, which have grace periods, and what emergency measures you would implement.
		      \item Design an alternative security model for online banking that could work in a post-P=NP world. What assumptions would you rely on instead?
		      \item Analyze why NP-complete problems, despite being \textit{``hard,''} wouldn't save us in this scenario. What's the fundamental difference between NP-complete hardness and cryptographic hardness?
	      \end{enumerate}
	\item (5 points) \textbf{The Weak DH Parameters Problem:}
	      A security researcher discovers that a popular cryptographic library has been generating Diffie-Hellman parameters where the prime $p$ satisfies $p-1$ having many small factors, making 75\% of generated groups vulnerable to Pohlig-Hellman attacks that reduce the discrete log problem to much smaller subgroups.
	      \begin{enumerate}
		      \item Evaluate whether this discovery completely breaks Diffie-Hellman or only partially weakens it. Consider both the mathematical impact and practical deployment consequences.
		      \item Design a strategy for systems using this library: should they immediately regenerate all parameters, implement parameter validation, or pursue a different approach?
		      \item Compare this scenario to a hypothetical breakthrough that reduces the discrete logarithm problem in prime-order groups by a factor of $2^{20}$ but still leaves it exponential. Which vulnerability would be more urgent to address and why?
	      \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Discrete Logarithm Security Architecture (10 points)}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item (5 points) \textbf{The Weak Parameter Disaster:}
	      Your security audit discovers that a legacy system has been using $p = 2047$ (which factors as $23 \times 89$) for Diffie-Hellman key exchange, and the generator $g = 2$.
	      \begin{enumerate}
		      \item Analyze exactly why this parameter choice is catastrophically weak. Estimate how long it would take an attacker with a modern laptop to break this system.
		      \item Design an emergency response plan: how do you migrate users to secure parameters while maintaining service availability?
		      \item Compare the security implications if the system had instead used a proper 2048-bit prime but with a generator that only generates a small subgroup.
	      \end{enumerate}
	\item (5 points) \textbf{Elliptic Curve vs. Finite Field Trade-off Analysis:}
	      You're designing a cryptographic protocol for IoT devices with severe computational and bandwidth constraints.
	      \begin{enumerate}
		      \item Compare elliptic curve and finite field DLP for your use case: which offers better security per bit of key size, and which offers better computational performance?
		      \item Analyze why index calculus attacks work against finite fields but not elliptic curves. How does this fundamental difference affect your security margins?
		      \item Design a hybrid approach that uses both elliptic curves and finite fields strategically. When might this provide benefits over using just one?
	      \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Diffie-Hellman in Hostile Environments (20 points)}

\subsection{Attack and Defense Scenarios (10 points)}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item (5 points) \textbf{The Perfect Man-in-the-Middle:}
	      An attacker has complete control over the network between Alice and Bob, can modify any message, and can initiate connections that appear to come from either party.
	      \begin{enumerate}
		      \item Design the most effective man-in-the-middle attack against unauthenticated Diffie-Hellman. Your attack should be undetectable to Alice and Bob during the key exchange.
		      \item Alice and Bob have never met but each has the other's public key fingerprint written on a piece of paper. Design an authentication protocol that defeats your attack using only these fingerprints.
		      \item Compare your fingerprint-based solution to certificate authorities and web-of-trust models. What are the usability and security trade-offs?
		      \item The attacker now has quantum capabilities. How does this change your attack and defense strategies?
	      \end{enumerate}
	\item (5 points) \textbf{The Paranoid Whistleblower Scenario:}
	      A whistleblower needs to securely communicate with a journalist. They assume the government monitors all internet traffic, has compromised most Certificate Authorities, and can perform man-in-the-middle attacks on any connection.
	      \begin{enumerate}
		      \item Design a key exchange protocol for this scenario using only methods available to ordinary civilians (no specialized hardware or pre-shared secrets).
		      \item Analyze what happens if the government can also compromise one of their devices after the key exchange. How can you provide forward secrecy?
		      \item Compare your solution to existing tools like Tor, Signal, and SecureDrop. What additional protection does your design provide?
	      \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Protocol Design Challenge (10 points)}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item (10 points) \textbf{SSH Trust-on-First-Use Analysis:}
	      Your organization wants to deploy SSH across 10,000 servers, but the current TOFU model creates security and usability problems at scale.
	      \begin{enumerate}
		      \item Analyze specific attack scenarios where the TOFU model fails in practice. When are users most vulnerable?
		      \item Design an improved authentication model that maintains SSH's simplicity while providing better security guarantees than pure TOFU.
		      \item Compare your solution to proposals like DNS-based SSH public key distribution (SSHFP records) and OAuth-based SSH certificates. What are the deployment challenges for each approach?
	      \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

	\item (5 points) \textbf{Mobile Performance Optimization Challenge:}
	      Your mobile app needs to perform thousands of ECDH operations per minute on low-end smartphones, but battery life and performance are critical concerns.
	      \begin{enumerate}
		      \item Compare the performance characteristics of different elliptic curves for your use case. Consider both computational cost and memory usage.
		      \item Design an optimization strategy that balances security and performance. Would you use precomputed tables, special curve forms, or other techniques?
		      \item Analyze the security implications of your optimizations: what new attack surfaces do they create?

	\item (10 points) \textbf{Key Exchange Protocol Design:}
	      You are designing a secure messaging application that needs to establish encrypted communication channels between users who have never communicated before. The application must work on mobile devices with limited computational resources and intermittent network connectivity.
	      \begin{enumerate}
		      \item Design a complete key exchange protocol using the cryptographic primitives from lectures 1.7 and 1.8. Your design should address:
